# Hit the Button Game

  My game is an arcade style game with the goal of hitting the button at the right time. A light will go around in a circle and the player will need to hit the left button at the right time when the light is in a random position on the     board, indicated by a green pixel. The moving light will speed up after every successful hit. It will stay the same speed if the light is missed. If the player misses 3 times, the game will end. Changing the switch mid game will end the game and restart it when it is turned back. 

# Rules

 * If the player misses the light more than 3 times, the game will end and the player will have to restart the game by clicking the right button.
 * The game will get faster and faster as the player gets better.
 * The game will play a low tone for a miss, and a high pitched tone for hit.
 * If the player gets a hit, their score will be increased.
 * If the player wants to end the game at any point, they can toggle the switch.


# Objective
